Open Source 3D printed protective gear


## FOR THE SLOVENIAN PRINTING TEAM ##
The model we'd like tested right now, the one for which the mail went out, is in the folder: Microbiological Breathing Filter Face Mask/breathing_filter_male_size.stl



## Print settings:

* Rafts: No
* Supports: No
* Resolution: 0.2
* Infill: 15%
* Filament_brand: Trcek
* Filament_material: PLA
* Notes: NO SUPPORTS NEEDED. We recommend 3 perimeters. PLA, for it's relative non-toxicity and personalization/fitting options.
* Printing position: The mask MUST BE PRINTED IN THE ORIGINAL ORIENTATION, as otherwise the filter seal could be compromised
